\chapter{Chapter 4: Ranking Algorithms}

\section{Introduction}
Typically, results returned from search engines are ranked in some way so as to return the more relevant search results first. For this task,  the following ranking algorithms were introduced:

\begin{itemize}

\item Term frequency

\item Inverse document - term frequency

\item Okapi BM25

which are different implementations of the same general idea: assigning a score to a search term based on some metric of relevance.

\end{itemize}

\section{Analysis}
A Score interface was created with only one method: getScore(String, Website, Index), and each of the following classes implemented this interface.
 
\subsection{IFScore class}


\subsection{IFIDFScore class}

\subsection{OkapiBM25 class}


\subsection{Testing}
