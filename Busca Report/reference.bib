   abstract      = { Capturing a wealth of experience about the design of object-oriented software,
 four top-notch designers present a catalog of simple and succinct solutions to commonly occurring design problems. 
Previously undocumented, these 23 patterns allow designers to create more flexible, elegant, and ultimately reusable
designs without having to rediscover the design solutions themselves. The authors begin by describing what patterns 
are and how they can help you design object-oriented software. They then go on to systematically name, explain, 
evaluate, and catalog recurring designs in object-oriented systems. With Design Patterns as your guide, you will learn
 how these important patterns fit into the software development process, and how you can leverage them to solve 
your own design problems most efficiently}

   year          = {2005},
   abstract      = {The practice of enterprise application development has benefited from the emergence of many new
 enabling technologies. Multi-tiered object-oriented platforms, such as Java and .NET, have become commonplace.
 These new tools and technologies are capable of building powerful applications, but they are not easily implemented.
 Common failures in enterprise applications often occur because their developers do not understand the architectural 
lessons that experienced object developers have learned. Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture is written in
 direct response to the stiff challenges that face enterprise application developers. The author, noted object-oriented
 designer Martin Fowler, noticed that despite changes in technology--from Smalltalk to CORBA to Java to .NET--the same
 basic design ideas can be adapted and applied to solve common problems. With the help of an expert group of contributors,
 Martin distills over forty recurring solutions into patterns. The result is an indispensable handbook of solutions that are applicable
 to any enterprise application platform.}
